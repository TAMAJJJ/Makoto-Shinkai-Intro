        <h2>Personal Quotes</h2>
        <p>The thing about getting rejected is that you reflect and think and analyze about why you got turned down. You
            learn a lot more from stories about getting rejected than stories about becoming happy. That's why I prefer
            those stories. If I
            must say something about Mari Okada...I love Toradora! (2008), which she wrote the screenplay for, a lot.
            And I think that The Garden of Words (2013) is influenced by the way the characters express their emotions
            in Toradora. I really do
            think that.

            In most of the world today people are interested in communication. They don't watch TV or play games that
            much;
            communication is becoming more of AN Entertainment form in itself. So when the society in which I live has
            this tendency
            that
            communication is so important, it has naturally become a central point of interest for my works.

            The first thing you make is a story. Then you decide where the location of the story will be, and how the
            story will
            develop. And then, when you think how the visuals will be in this process, then you finally think about how
            you take
            something from the setting and use it, how to depict it, and how to make the setting beautiful. That's when
            you begin to
            think that. So the story always comes first.

            I am offered the chance sometimes to work with an anime series, and it is something I feel I should try and
            be a part
            of, but at the moment I do not feel like I am ready for it yet and that I have not done enough work. But I
            am really
            interested in doing an anime series one day.
            Ever since I was a child I always had cats with me. I'm from the Nagano prefecture, and while living there I
            had cats,
            and after I came to Tokyo I also picked up some strays and started raising them. So I definitely always had
            cats with
            me.
