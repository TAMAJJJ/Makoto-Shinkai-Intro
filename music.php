        <p>For nearly 20 years now, the rock band RADWIMPS has been capturing hearts with their uniquely sentimental,
            deeply meaningful and pop-friendly artistic style - they've sold millions of albums in Japan and around the
            globe. This didn't
            escape the notice of world-famous anime auteur Makoto Shinkai, who chose them to score his megahit (and
            still the highest grossing animated film in Japan) your name. - and their presence in the film's soundtrack
            is credited with creating
            an undeniable aesthetic atmosphere that elevated the movie to new heights, enabling it to connect with
            audiences worldwide. Shinkai's new film, Weathering With You, is out this week in the US - and we got the
            chance to speak with RADWIMPS
            about their career, their influences, and how they feel about being associated so directly with one of the
            most successful anime creators of all time.</p>

        <p>
            In most of the world today people are interested in communication. They don't watch TV or play games that
            much;
            communication is becoming more of AN Entertainment form in itself. So when the society in which I live has
            this tendency
            that
            communication is so important, it has naturally become a central point of interest for my works.
